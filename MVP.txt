# Application - PortMan (Portfolio Manager) (MVP)

## Main problem
I manage and track my investment portfolio in Excel and calculate everything manually or using
formulas. I would like to automate and simplify the entire process.

## Minimum set of features
-Adding and removing items.
-Changing names and amounts of items.
-Option to indicate the type of item, e.g., stocks, ETFs, bonds.
-Adding sold/unsold options for items.
-Calculating profits and losses for specific items and the entire portfolio (with an option to include or exclude unsold items).

## What is NOT included in the MVP
-Use of AI via API or in any other way. 
-Adding additional features beyond the previously specified minimum.

## Success criteria
I have an application in which, when I purchase shares, I can add them to my portfolio, enter
the amount I paid, and when I sell them, add the sale amount. The differences from such transactions will be calculated.
