# The app should include:

-User login support (auth)

-One function with business logic

-One CRUD function (data management operations, e.g., resource list)

-A working, meaningful test (unit - testing a specific function or e2e - testing flow through the application)

-CI/CD scenario on Github Actions (e.g., automatic test execution)
